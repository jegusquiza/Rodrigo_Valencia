      <h2>
        <br><br>
      Born and raised in Lima, Rodrigo Valencia is a director of photography dedicated to
      documenting the universal human experience through the lens of each individual's
      personal journey. His interest in visual storytelling sparked at a young age thanks
      to his uncle, a DP who brought him along on shoots and taught him how to use his very
      first camera. <br><br> Moving to the United States in search of better opportunities, he
      graduated from Rutgers University with a major in film production and a minor in art.
      He got his start as one of the first employees at CNNâ€™s Great Big Story, where he cut
      his teeth on over 30 documentaries over the course of 3 years. <br><br> Rodrigo has also had
      experience working on narrative films, commercials, music videos and fashion films for
      a variety of clients. His passion, his eye and his passport will send him to great
      lengths for the sake of the story.
